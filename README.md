# AndroidStringFormatValidator

The localizations of Android strings from crowdsourcing platform might break the string formatters. 

** Example: **
```xml
<!-- value/strings.xml -->
<string name="sample_text">sample text with format: %s</string>
	
<!-- value-es/strings.xml -->
<string name="sample_text">sample text with format: % s</string>
```
The %s formatting characters are broken after tranlsation. To identify such erros before releasing build, we can just add a custom gradle task, checkString, before the preBuild stage of the assemble task. 

ï¼·ith the custom "checkString" task, the errors would be identified and displayed with the build ouput log: 

    Executing tasks: [assemble] in project /Users/kennylee/code/Github/AndroidStringFormatValidator
